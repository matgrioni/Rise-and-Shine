A simple app with simple intentions, Rise and Shine (RAS) counts the amount of times per day you wake your phone. The app only invokes the count when necessary and therefore has a very low impact on the battery. On top of this, RAS has the ability to sort the information into nifty graphs that can be changed to display wake counts by yearly, monthly, weekly, or even daily progressions. The accumulated data can also be saved as a CSV file if you so desire.

Enjoy!
